## 📂 Code Structure

The project is structured into three main files, following the principle of separation of concerns:

-   **`index.html`**: Contains the basic HTML structure of the form, including all input fields, labels, and containers.
-   **`style.css`**: Holds all the styling rules. It uses CSS custom properties (variables) for easy theme management and media queries for responsiveness.
-   **`script.js`**: This file is the "brain" of the form. It handles all the logic, including:
    -   Selecting DOM elements.
    -   Adding event listeners for user interactions (`submit`, `input`, `blur`).
    -   Implementing validation logic for each field.
    -   Displaying and hiding error messages.
    -   Showing the success message upon valid submission.

## 🌟 Future Improvements

-   **Backend Integration:** Integrate with a backend service like **Formspree** or a custom API to actually send and store the feedback data.
-   **Accessibility (a11y) Enhancements:** Add ARIA attributes to improve accessibility for screen reader users.
-   **More Input Types:** Include other form elements like checkboxes or radio buttons for more detailed feedback.
-   **Reset Button:** Add a button to clear all form fields.
